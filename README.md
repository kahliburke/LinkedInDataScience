# LinkedIn Data Science
This is a space where I can share and display notebooks and other code related to data science and ML/AI. Posts from LinkedIn will reference these materials to allow others to interact with the data analysis topics I explore.

Please feel free to fork and modify and utilize with your own data sets of interest. Don't forget to give me feedback, whether that's complimentary or critical. We all need to hear from others about the work we do to improve our skills and selves. I'm happy to interact with you if you're intersted in some aspect of what you see here. Please get in touch!

Warm regards,
